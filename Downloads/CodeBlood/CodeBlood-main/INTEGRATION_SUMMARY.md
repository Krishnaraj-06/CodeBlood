# OCR Dashboard Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully merged the preprocessing dashboard with the OCR dashboard to create an automated workflow.

## Key Changes

### 1. **server.py** - Automatic Handoff
- **Line 147**: After preprocessing completes, the system automatically redirects to the OCR batch processing route
- **New Route `/ocr-batch/<run_id>`** (lines 246-295): Processes all cleaned images through OCR and generates individual CSV files
- **Per-Image CSV Generation**: Each cleaned image gets its own CSV file stored in `static/runs/<run_id>/csv/`

### 2. **gemini.py** - PNG Support
- **Lines 98-100**: Added automatic MIME type detection to support both PNG and JPEG images
- Processed images are saved as PNG, so this ensures OCR works correctly

### 3. **templates/ocr_dashboard.html** - Batch Results Display
- **Lines 64-95**: New batch results section showing multiple images with their corresponding CSV data
- Each result card displays:
  - Cleaned image preview
  - Extracted attendance table
  - Student count
  - Individual CSV download button
- **Line 69-71**: "Download all CSV (ZIP)" button for bulk download

### 4. **New Download Routes**
- **`/download/csv/<run_id>/<filename>`** (lines 298-304): Download individual CSV files
- **`/download/csv-zip/<run_id>`** (lines 307-321): Download all CSVs as a ZIP archive

## Workflow

1. **Upload & Preprocess** (`/dashboard`)
   - User uploads attendance sheets (PDF/images)
   - System applies preprocessing (deskew, threshold, denoise, etc.)
   - Cleaned images are saved to `static/runs/<run_id>/cleaned/`

2. **Automatic OCR Processing** (`/ocr-batch/<run_id>`)
   - System automatically redirects after preprocessing
   - Each cleaned image is processed through Gemini OCR
   - Individual CSV files are generated: `cleaned_01.csv`, `cleaned_02.csv`, etc.
   - All CSVs stored in `static/runs/<run_id>/csv/`

3. **Results & Download**
   - View all results in a grid layout
   - Download individual CSVs per image
   - Download all CSVs as a single ZIP file

## File Structure
```
static/runs/<run_id>/
├── input/          # Original uploaded images
├── cleaned/        # Preprocessed images
└── csv/            # OCR-extracted CSV files (one per image)
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501/dashboard`

3. Upload attendance sheets and configure preprocessing settings

4. Click "Run Preprocessing" - the system will automatically:
   - Clean the images
   - Run OCR on each image
   - Generate separate CSV files
   - Display all results

5. Download options:
   - Individual CSV: Click "Download CSV" on each result card
   - All CSVs: Click "Download all CSV (ZIP)" at the top

## API Key
Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file for OCR to work.
